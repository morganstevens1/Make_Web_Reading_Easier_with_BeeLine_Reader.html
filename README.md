# Make_Web_Reading_Easier_with_BeeLine_Reader.html
Hello,
Here is what I wrote for the article "Make Web Reading Easier with BeeLine Reader" I took from the website along with the school website (https://www.brynmawr.edu/access-services/assistive-technology-features-and-resources)
I also have a PDF attached with what I wrote. Please feel free to change anything.
If you would like to email me my email is mmstevens@brynmawr.edu
Thank you
